## Why no-shows cost more than you think

As a salon or spa owner, your time is your most valuable asset. Every empty slot is not just a missed haircut or color — it's lost revenue, wasted product, staff downtime, and a dent in your daily rhythm. A single 90-minute booking lost to a no-show may cost hundreds in revenue; multiply that across weeks and it’s easy to see the cumulative damage.

No-shows also have soft costs:
- Disappointed stylists who could have been booked.
- Reduced morale and unpredictability in payroll.
- Clients who could have been moved off a waitlist never had the chance.
- Scheduling chaos that erodes premium service delivery.

The good news: the root causes of most no-shows are simple (forgetting, schedule conflicts, low commitment), and the remedies are straightforward, inexpensive, and scalable.

# 1 — Implement automated appointment reminders (the biggest impact)

### Why it works
People are busy. Forgetting is the most common reason for no-shows. Automation simply fills the human memory gap. Multi-channel reminders (email + SMS) create redundancy so a message reaches the client when they’re most likely to see it.

### Timing strategy (recommended)
- **Immediately after booking** — Confirmation email (warm, personal).
- **48 hours before** — Email reminder with details + rescheduling link.
- **24 hours before** — SMS reminder: short, direct, one-click reschedule or confirm.
- **2 hours before** (optional for same-day services) — Short SMS nudge.

### Multi-step example flow
1. Booking confirmation (email): full details, map, cancellation policy link.
2. 48-hour reminder (email): “Still good for [date/time]?”
3. 24-hour reminder (SMS): “Reply YES to confirm or click to reschedule.”
4. Day-of short SMS if applicable.

### Email template — immediate confirmation
